 Iterates over all the objects in an array and calls the block on each object
 
 This iterates over all the objects in an array calling the block on each object
 until it reaches the end of the array or until the BOOL *stop pointer is set to YES.
 This method was inspired by Ruby's each method and works very similarly to it, while
 at the same time staying close to existing ObjC standards for block arguments which
 is why it passes a BOOL *stop pointer allowing you to signal for enumeration to end.
 
 Important! If block is nil then this method will throw an exception.
 
 @param obj (Block Parameter) this is the object in the array currently being enumerated over
 @param index (Block Parameter) this is the index of obj in the array
 @param stop (Block Parameter) set this to YES to stop enumeration, otherwise there is no need to use this	*/

 Enumerates over the receiving arrays objects concurrently in a synchronous method.
 
 Enumerates over all the objects in the receiving array concurrently. That is it will
 go over each object and execute a block passing that object in the array as a parameter 
 in the block. This methods asynchronously executes a block for all objects in the array
 but waits for all blocks to finish executing before going on.
 
 @param index (Block Parameter) the position of the object in the array
 @param obj (Block Parameter) the object being enumerated over
 @param stop (Block Parameter) if you need to stop the enumeration set this to YES otherwise do nothing	*/
