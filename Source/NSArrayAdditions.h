 Iterates over all the objects in an array and calls the block on each object
 
 This iterates over all the objects in an array calling the block on each object
 until it reaches the end of the array or until the BOOL *stop pointer is set to
 YES. This method was inspired by Ruby's each method and works very similarly to
 it, while at the same time staying close to existing ObjC standards for block 
 arguments which is why it passes a BOOL *stop pointer allowing you to signal 
 for enumeration to end.
 
 Important! If block is nil then this method will throw an exception.
