 any key/value pair to the dictionary, then simply return nil in the block.

 Returns a new dictionary with key/value pairs from the receiver passing test
 
 This method creates a new NSDictionary instance and finds all entries in the

 and then returns that new dictionary at the end of the method.
 
 The block takes in the key and value pairs from the receiver dictionary and
 passes them to you for evaluation. If you return YES then that key/value pair
 is added to the new NSDictionary instance, otherwise if you return NO then
 it will be omitted from the dictionary returned.
