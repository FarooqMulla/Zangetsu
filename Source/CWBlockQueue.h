/**
 CWBlockQueue is a lightweight alternative to NSOperationQueue
 Its job is to manage a GCD Queue (dispatch_queue_t) & make it easy to
 do things you wanted to do with NSOperationQueue like set target queues,
 set operations with completion blocks, barrier blocks, etc. Unlike 
 NSOperation(Queue) CWBlockQueue has been designed from the beginning for
 asynchronous operations, you can do some synchronous operations, but
 the bulk of the class has been designed with asynchronous operations in mind.
 This means the queue is not concerned with the state of operations, which is 
 why CWBlockOperation has no -isExecuting -isFinished, etc.
