# Zangetsu Framework #

Zangetsu is a general purpose 64 bit ARC enabled Framework for Mac OS X 10.7 and as a static library for iOS 5. It has a number of convenience functions and Foundation categories that help in the development of Mac OS X Cocoa & iOS Cocoa Touch applications. It is the framework that helps power many of my apps. Going forward as I can more and more non application specific code from my apps will be added to this Framework. This framework is made available under the nonviral Open Source MIT License. Although it is not required, if you do use this I'd love it if you let me know what apps you use this in. Thanks!

Note: As a library for iOS 5 this project is still in the early stages of development right now. It is stable on Mac OS X, but is undergoing work to port code from Mac OS X to iOS.

## What does Zangetsu mean? ##

Zangetsu ( 斬月 ) is Japanese and means Slaying Moon. The inspiration for the name for this project comes from the Japanese Anime Bleach. Specifically a character called Ichigo Kurosaki and his zanpakutō ( 斬魄刀 literally "soul-cutter sword" ). It is a sword that takes many shapes. In the same way I intend this framework to do the same.

## Where is the Documentation ##
There is Doxygen support in the framework. All you need to do is download Doxygen and generate the documentation from the Doxyfile

## Where do I report bugs? ##
File issues in the issue section on the github project.
